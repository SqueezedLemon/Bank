# Bank Account

Welcome to the Bank Account project! This simple demo allows users to create an account, deposit and withdraw funds, and view their transaction histories. The project is built using .NET 8, employs JWT bearer tokens and refresh tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies for authorization, and utilizes Entity Framework with a code-first approach, requiring migration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
